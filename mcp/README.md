# @canopy-ai/mcp

[Canopy](https://www.trycanopy.ai) as an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server. Drop it into Claude Desktop, Cursor, or Cline and whichever agent runs in that host gets a policy-gated `canopy_pay` tool — no code changes required.

## What this is for

You're running an agent inside a host app (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline, Windsurf) and you don't want to modify its source to add payment capability. MCP is the neutral plug. You add Canopy once to the host's config, every conversation in that host can now pay.

## Setup

1. **Create an org** at <https://www.trycanopy.ai>.
2. **Generate an API key**: Dashboard → Settings → API Keys → Create. Copy the `ak_live_…`.
3. **Create an agent**: Dashboard → Agents → Add Agent. Copy the `agt_…` id.
4. **Add Canopy to your MCP host config** (below).

You don't install `@canopy-ai/mcp` globally. `npx` fetches it on first run.

## Host configs

### Claude Desktop

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "canopy": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@canopy-ai/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "CANOPY_API_KEY": "ak_live_...",
        "CANOPY_AGENT_ID": "agt_xxxxxxxx"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. In any new conversation, the hammer icon (tools) should list `canopy_pay` and `canopy_preview`.

### Cursor

Edit `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (or the workspace-scoped `.cursor/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "canopy": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@canopy-ai/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "CANOPY_API_KEY": "ak_live_...",
        "CANOPY_AGENT_ID": "agt_xxxxxxxx"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Cursor. Tools appear in the agent sidebar.

### Cline / Windsurf / other MCP hosts

Any MCP host with a `mcpServers` config block will work with the same shape — `command: npx`, `args: ["-y", "@canopy-ai/mcp"]`, the two env vars.

## Available tools

Two tools, one simple surface:

### `canopy_pay`

Send a USD payment from the org treasury. Subject to the org's spending policy.

**Arguments**
```json
{
  "to": "0x1234... or agentic.market/anthropic",
  "amountUsd": 0.10
}
```

**Returns** (as JSON text content)
```json
{
  "status": "allowed",
  "txHash": "0x...",
  "transactionId": "...",
  "costUsd": 0.10
}
```

Other outcomes the LLM needs to reason about:

```json
{ "status": "pending_approval", "approvalId": "...", "reason": "Amount $7.50 exceeds approval threshold of $5" }
{ "status": "denied", "reason": "Spend cap exceeded: $8.00 + $5.00 > $10 / 24h" }
```

### `canopy_preview`

Dry-run the same policy evaluation without signing or charging. Useful when the LLM wants to ask "would this payment go through?" before committing.

Same argument shape as `canopy_pay`. Returns a `PayResult` with `"dryRun": true`.

## How the LLM experiences it

Once the server is loaded, the host exposes both tools in its normal tool UI. The LLM decides when to call `canopy_pay`; the host runs the call; Canopy's policy engine decides `allowed` / `pending_approval` / `denied`; the result comes back as tool output the LLM reads. A typical prompt flow:

> **You:** send $0.10 to 0x1234…
> **LLM:** *[calls `canopy_pay({ to: "0x1234…", amountUsd: 0.10 })`]*
> *[tool returns `{ "status": "allowed", "txHash": "0xabc…" }`]*
> **LLM:** Done. Transaction: 0xabc…

If the amount exceeds the approval threshold, the LLM sees `pending_approval` and will usually tell the user to approve in the dashboard. Approvals happen in the Canopy web dashboard, not inside the MCP host.

## Custom base URL (local dev)

Point the MCP server at a locally-running canopy-app:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "canopy": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@canopy-ai/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "CANOPY_API_KEY": "ak_test_...",
        "CANOPY_AGENT_ID": "agt_...",
        "CANOPY_BASE_URL": "http://localhost:3000"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Use a test-mode key (`ak_test_…`) so you don't pollute production data.

## Troubleshooting

**Tools don't appear in the host** — the server probably failed to start. Check the host's MCP log (Claude Desktop: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-canopy.log`). Common causes:

- `CANOPY_API_KEY environment variable is required` — env var not set in the host config.
- `CANOPY_AGENT_ID environment variable is required` — same.
- npm resolution failures — delete the npx cache (`~/.npm/_npx/`) and retry.

**`canopy_pay` returns `denied` with "Privy is not configured"** — the canopy-app server doesn't have `PRIVY_APP_ID` set. Production shouldn't hit this; check with ops if it does.

**`canopy_pay` returns `denied` with "Spend cap exceeded"** — the agent has spent its cap in the current window. Wait it out or raise the cap in the dashboard.

**`canopy_pay` returns `pending_approval` and just hangs** — MCP tools return synchronously and we don't poll. Open the dashboard, decide the approval, then ask the LLM to retry — it'll pick up the allowed result via idempotency on the same call.

## What's under the hood

`@canopy-ai/mcp` is a thin wrapper around [`@canopy-ai/sdk`](../typescript). It's an stdio MCP server (the official `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`) that exposes `canopy.pay` and `canopy.preview` as MCP tools. No custody — the server just proxies to Canopy's API with your key.
